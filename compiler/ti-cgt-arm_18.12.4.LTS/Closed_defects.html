In this case, it's expressed as "c += X; c += Y", where X and Y are int32_t and c is int64_t. The compiler is turning that into "c += X + Y", which adds X and Y as int32_t and thus doesn't keep the 33rd bit.</td>

In the test case given, the file sys_pcr.obj contains functions that are not called anywhere and therefore are not included in the .out file.  However, due to some quirk that we have not yet isolated, the debug info for sys_pcr.obj *is* included.  When the profile decoder collects its data, it uses the debug info to locate it;  the faulty extra debug info points to invalid locations, causing the warnings.

Second, making g_sys_opmode volatile does indeed work around the problem.  Since the "volatile" qualifier tells the compiler that something is modifying the variable outside the compiler's view, that's exactly what is needed to keep it from being assumed constant.



Third, removing the asm() from main.c will work around the problem, by including main.c in the recompilation.  I modified EINT/DINT and EALLOW/EDIS macros in F2806x_Device.h and two cpu.h files, making them use the intrinsics __enable_interrupts, __disable_interrupts, __eallow, and __edis.  As it happens, __enable_interrupts and __disable_interrupts control both INTM and DBGM, while the macros control them individually, so this may not be a completely satisfactory solution.</td>
        <td>The immediate trigger for the bug is that main.c contains asm() statements.  That's the only file that sets g_sys_opmode;  other files only read it.  The presence of asm() keeps the file out of the recompilation that -O4 does.  The compiler, however, still thinks it has the whole program (or at least the important parts);  since it doesn't see main.c, it doesn't see the writes, and concludes that g_sys_opmode is a constant 0.</td>

The source code has to have one or more IFs, followed by a nested scope that isn't part of a compound statement and defines local variables, followed by a loop.  Another workaround is thus to move the local variable definitions to the enclosing scope.  (Another that works for the given test case but isn't necessarily general is to initialise all those local variables, where they're defined in the nested scope.)



Normal debug info must be present;  a final workaround is therefore to use --symdebug:none to suppress debug info.  Of course, that makes debugging difficult.</td>

This sequence is not something a human asm programmer would write.
